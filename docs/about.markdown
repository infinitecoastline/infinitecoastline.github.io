# About the Author and this blog

My name is Ben. I'm a writer, and this blog is a place for me to share whatever I feel like publishing to the internet.

I'm an international adventurer, father to Niko, husband to Kt, dad to our dogs Max and Mando. I've had a bunch of technical jobs in my career from technical support, business systems analyst, and I'm currently a technical writer.

I've always enjoyed writing. I studied creative writing and English literature at university and loved it, but never made it my profession (until now).

Thank you for reading!
