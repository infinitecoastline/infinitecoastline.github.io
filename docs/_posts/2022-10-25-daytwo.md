# 5 minute journal
Today a mechanic confirmed that our car was not worth repairing, but it is okay to continue driving for now. That was a little disheartening.

It just has to last until we move back to the US.

That's time. Good night and much love.

# Hot take

I saw a ridiculous influencer post on instagram. Someting like rules for success in your twenties.

It was all a bunch of pseudo-scientific garbage. Do 100 pushups every day. Stop drinking alcohol and eating sugar to detox your dopamine levels.

The worst one was "quit drugs and masturbation". Are you kidding me? What the hell do those two things have in common?

These people, bots, and content farms have to stop telling people what to do with their lives.

Life is short, and also incredibly long, boring, and full of waiting. Happiness and excitement are rare enough without trying to follow someone else's abitrary rules.

There's so much noise trying to influence us to buy things, distract us from what's really going on, and to think a certain way.

It's good to be challenged with new information and change your mind, but not if it's just unsolicited opinions pretending to be wisdom.

How do we connect with reality if we're only exposed to it through systems with agendas, and people with their own probably selfish motivations?
