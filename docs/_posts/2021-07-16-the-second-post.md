I'm going tell you a little bit about how I see the world.

The universe is a chaotic place. Is trying to create order a mistake? Doesn't that just lead to frustration, that the work we do to control things will eventually lead to nothing?

Chaotic energy is as real to me as gravity, and it's just as universal. We just don't know enough about it. We assume that gravity exists because this planet has mass. We don't know why there's so much chaos in the universe, where it comes from, or how it manifests itself in nature or human behavior.

All that being said, we have to put in effort to do good things, take action, make change, and create something out of nothing. I just think we need to act with the understanding that everything we do can and will be swallowed whole by the chaotic forces present in the fabric of the universe.

I also think that everything is part of the whole: making distinctions between things is a flawed approach. We have to use these tools - like defining things, separating one thing from another - to keep from being totally overwhelmed by reality.

The human brain works specifically to limit our ability to perceive things, in order to operate efficiently and effectively. That's not a bad thing, we just have to recognize and respect that our perception of everything is flawed, and that we're missing the big picture that it seems like we're not meant to be able to see.


More to come...
