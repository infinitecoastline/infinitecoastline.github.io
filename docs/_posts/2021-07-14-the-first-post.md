This is the first post I'm making on this new blog. I've had other blogs in the past where I've shared random bits of information during my travels. This is just a place where I can publish stories and bits of writing that I feel like sharing online.  
  
This blog has also been an adventure in some light coding.  
  
Here's how I built it:
1. Setup a new GitHub account and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (a website to host the blog website)
2. Created a repo to use with GitHub pages
3. Clone the repo to my desktop
4. Test out GitHub Pages with a basic index.html page
5. Install a bunch of things on my computer including `x-code-select`, `ruby`, and `jekyll`
6. Troubleshoot the installation because it didn't work at first (including a good amount of googling and reading documentation)
7. Reinstall the items from step 5 (at least once)
8. Delete a really important line of code from a system file on my mac (`.zshrc` which controls what you can do in Terminal)
9. Troubleshoot why commands in Terminal aren't working anymore (add the important line back in: `export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"`)
10. Reinstall everything from step 5 again (even though I probably didn't need to)
11. Create a new `docs` folder in the repo and set it as the source for website updates (so anything I put in that folder, `add`, `commit`, `push` and `merge` will automatically update the GitHub pages website)
12. Create a jekyll site in the `docs` folder and test it out
13. Make some basic changes and test the publishing process end to end
14. Write this post and publish it!  
  
You can follow the instructions on the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) website to do this yourself!  
  
As far as a little development project goes (from my limited experience of them) I'd say that's a pretty normal experience because it included:  
- Trying something new for the first time
- Learning new information and getting overwhelmed (what the heck is Ruby? What are gems and what does this error message mean?)
- Figuring out why things aren't working properly, even though I followed the instructions
- Making a mistake, and having to figure out why it's not working
- Once it's working, testing to make sure it works the way I expect it to
- Getting familiar with new concepts like [markdown language](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)  
  
At any point in the process, I could have *so easily* given up and quit. Instead, I pressed on, confident that what I was trying to do wasn't impossible, and I just had to take a deep breath, dive in, and figure it out.  

And here it is!  
  
Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy the journey with me!
